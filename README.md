## Customization:
Gojo theme has almost every line of code with a description making it easy and user-friendly to edit to your preference! 

## Installing Gojo theme: 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Theme does disable light mode and dark mode and applies the same properties to both of them, only found issue is in the GIF selection it still appears white.
> Temporary resolution: Switch from light mode to dark mode.

1. Download `Gojo-Theme.css` or copy contents of folder from this repo.
2. Put the file into your theme folder. (there should be a button to open the theme folder in theme settings)
3. Customize the theme in `Gojo-Theme.css`.
